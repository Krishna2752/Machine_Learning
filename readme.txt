This is my first attempt at the Kaggle Titanic contest using a simple logistic regression model
to predict the probability of survival of the passengers on the Titanic taking into account the factors of
Age, Class of Travel and Gender to train the model.
In order to run this code it must be copied to RStudio and the required libraries must be installed.
Included in this repository are:
1.Test set and Training set as available on Kaggle.
2. .r file which includes the code that was used to run the logistic regression model.
3. A sample submission as available on Kaggle as well as my own predictions in .csv format.
